# Frontend Environment Variables

# IMPORTANT: NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are BUILD-TIME variables.
# They are baked into the JavaScript bundle during 'npm run build'.
# If you are building with Docker, you must provide these during the build process
# or ensure they are set in the environment where 'next build' runs.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# NODE_ENV is usually set to production for deployments
NODE_ENV=production
